# IoT-based-Vehicle-Tracking-System-and-Maintenance-Alert

To track the location of the device and give regular maintenance alerts

**Objectives:**
<p>• <b> Real-Time Vehicle Tracking:</b>  Develop a system capable of providing real-time location tracking for vehicles using GPS or other location-based technologies.Ensure accurate and reliable tracking information to improve overall fleet visibility.</p>
<p>• <b> Maintenance Alert System:</b>  Implement an IoT-based system to monitor vehicle health and performance parameters in real time.Develop predictive maintenance algorithms to detect potential issues before they escalate.Generate automated maintenance alerts for timely servicing and repairs.</p>
<p>•	<b> Data Security and Privacy:</b>  Implement robust security measures to protect sensitive data, including location information and maintenance records.Comply with privacy regulations and standards to ensure user data is handled securely.</p>
<p>•	<b> Customizable Alerts and Notifications:</b>  Allow users to customize alert thresholds for different vehicle parameters.Implement a notification system that alerts users through various channels (e.g., mobile apps, email, SMS) based on predefined conditions.</p>

**Features:**
<p>•	<b>Real-Time GPS Tracking:</b> Utilize GPS modules with the ESP32 to enable real-time tracking of vehicle locations.Transmit GPS data to a central server or cloud platform for storage and analysis.</p>
<p>•	<b>Remote Diagnostics:</b> Enable remote diagnostic capabilities to troubleshoot and identify vehicle issues without physical inspection.Implement two-way communication for sending commands to the vehicle's diagnostic systems.</p>
<p>•	<b>Mobile App Integration:</b> Create a mobile application for users to access the tracking system on smartphones and receive alerts.Ensure compatibility with both iOS and Android platforms.</p>
