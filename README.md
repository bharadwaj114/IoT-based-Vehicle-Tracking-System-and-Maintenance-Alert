To track the location of the device and give regular maintenance alerts

<h2 style="font-family:Kobuzan;">Objectives:</h2>
<p>• <b> Real-Time Vehicle Tracking:</b>  Develop a system capable of providing real-time location tracking for vehicles using GPS or other location-based technologies.Ensure accurate and reliable tracking information to improve overall fleet visibility.</p>
<p>• <b> Maintenance Alert System:</b>  Implement an IoT-based system to monitor vehicle health and performance parameters in real time.Develop predictive maintenance algorithms to detect potential issues before they escalate.Generate automated maintenance alerts for timely servicing and repairs.</p>
<p>•	<b> Data Security and Privacy:</b>  Implement robust security measures to protect sensitive data, including location information and maintenance records.Comply with privacy regulations and standards to ensure user data is handled securely.</p>
<p>•	<b> Customizable Alerts and Notifications:</b>  Allow users to customize alert thresholds for different vehicle parameters.Implement a notification system that alerts users through various channels (e.g., mobile apps, email, SMS) based on predefined conditions.</p>

<h2>Features:</h2>
<p>•	<b>Real-Time GPS Tracking:</b> Utilize GPS modules with the ESP32 to enable real-time tracking of vehicle locations.Transmit GPS data to a central server or cloud platform for storage and analysis.</p>
<p>•	<b>Remote Diagnostics:</b> Enable remote diagnostic capabilities to troubleshoot and identify vehicle issues without physical inspection.Implement two-way communication for sending commands to the vehicle's diagnostic systems.</p>
<p>•	<b>Mobile App Integration:</b> Create a mobile application for users to access the tracking system on smartphones and receive alerts.Ensure compatibility with both iOS and Android platforms.</p>
<p>•	<b>Interconnectivity:</b> IoT-enables interconnectivity between the assets means the vehicle details are displayed on the user's connected dashboard for quick access.</p>
<p>•	<b>Improved Operational Efficiency:</b> An IoTized vehicle is a smart system that enables efficient performance. It improves productivity and returns the average of the vehicle by pre-defining the maintenance schedules and operational needs of the owner.</p>
<p>•	<b>Environmental Sustainability:</b> It is estimated that the use of IoT reduces vehicles to travel to the site by 68%, which results in lower fuel consumption rates, thus produces minimized carbon footprint. Also, when the vehicles are interconnected through technology, the risk of accidents and injuries reduces to a significant level, thus increasing the vehicle's efficiency.</p> 
<p>•	<b>Preventative Maintenance:</b> The user or transportation business owner can get a better insight regarding the driver’s behavior by staying connected to every vehicle through IoT technology. It allows the user to monitor the vehicle’s overall health from any interconnected device and obtain real-time alerts as desired.</p>
<p>•	<b>Easy Recovery of Stolen Car:</b> Easy Recovery of Stolen Car: In case of theft, a VTS can help the car owner or the police to locate the stolen vehicle quickly and increase the chances of recovery.</p>
<p>•	<b>Gaining Insights:</b> A VTS can also provide data on the car's speed, fuel consumption, and maintenance status, helping the car owner to keep the car in good condition and plan for regular maintenance.</p>
<p>•	<b>Peace of Mind:</b> A VTS can give an individual car owner peace of mind by allowing them to track the location of their vehicle in real time, especially when they are away from their car.</p>
