# IoT-based-Vehicle-Tracking-System-and-Maintenance-Alert

To track the location of the device and give regular maintenance alerts

**Objectives:**
• **Real-Time Vehicle Tracking:** Develop a system capable of providing real-time location tracking for vehicles using GPS or other location-based technologies.Ensure accurate and reliable tracking information to improve overall fleet visibility.
•**Maintenance Alert System:** Implement an IoT-based system to monitor vehicle health and performance parameters in real time.Develop predictive maintenance algorithms to detect potential issues before they escalate.Generate automated maintenance alerts for timely servicing and repairs.
•	**Data Security and Privacy:** Implement robust security measures to protect sensitive data, including location information and maintenance records.Comply with privacy regulations and standards to ensure user data is handled securely.
•	**Customizable Alerts and Notifications:** Allow users to customize alert thresholds for different vehicle parameters.Implement a notification system that alerts users through various channels (e.g., mobile apps, email, SMS) based on predefined conditions.

**Features:**
<p>•	<h1>Real-Time GPS Tracking:</h1> Utilize GPS modules with the ESP32 to enable real-time tracking of vehicle locations.Transmit GPS data to a central server or cloud platform for storage and analysis.</p>
<p>•	<h1>Remote Diagnostics:</h1> Enable remote diagnostic capabilities to troubleshoot and identify vehicle issues without physical inspection.Implement two-way communication for sending commands to the vehicle's diagnostic systems.</p>
<p>•	<h1>Mobile App Integration:</h1> Create a mobile application for users to access the tracking system on smartphones and receive alerts.Ensure compatibility with both iOS and Android platforms.</p>
